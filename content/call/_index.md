## Call

A long-standing observation (since at least Fodor (1970)) is that in certain contexts, sentences containing plurals are neither judged true nor judged false. This curious gap in meaning has been dubbed homogeneity. Throughout the literature, homogeneity effects have been extensively documented, both for plurals and other constructions: mass (REF), group nouns (REF Lobner), time (REF Agha), etc. It is also a remarkably stable feature across languages (REF). 

The stability and pervasiveness of homogeneity beg for a general theory. Yet, despite the extensive attention paid to such effects (CITE most representative constructions), many unknowns remain. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on homogeneity and try to tackle the issues. We therefore invite contributions on any of the following questions:

**Guiding questions:**

  - Which semantic phenomena in natural languages should be analyzed in terms of homogeneity, especially beyond the standard cases of definite plurals and conjunctions (bare conditionals, neg-raising verbs, generics, tense/aspect, subatomic part quantification, etc.)? 
  - Which semantic/pragmatic mechanisms give rise to homogeneity effects? How, if at all, should homogeneity be integrated into general theories of strengthening phenomena that have been developed on the basis of scalar implicatures?
  - What is the relation between homogeneity and vagueness/scalar predication? Could some/all of the phenomena that are currently analyzed in terms of homogeneity actually involve borderline cases of vague/imprecise scalar predicates?
  - How does non-maximality relate to homogeneity – in particular, should non-maximality and homogeneity be attributed to a common semantic source, and if so, how does the pragmatics of non-maximality constrain semantic theories of homogeneity?
  - What is the semantics of homogeneity-canceling expressions? Which generalizations are there about the set of expressions that remove homogeneity – in particular, is there a general connection between homogeneity and referentiality/definiteness? 
  - How does homogeneity project, i.e. how can the truth-value gaps of complex expressions be predicted from the truth-value gaps of their parts?
  - What is the cross-linguistic landscape of items that exhibit homogeneity, or that consistently lack it? Are there meaningful differences in homogeneity across languages? Which features of homogeneity are universal and which are not?
  - In what ways do child and adult language differ in the use and understanding of homogeneous expressions? How do these facts constrain theories of homogeneity?
  - What is the relationship between homogeneity effects and other gappy phenomena, such as presuppositions, implicatures, and more importantly scalar predicate vagueness? Are these different phenomena or the same ?
